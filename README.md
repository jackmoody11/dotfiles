My Dotfiles
===========

This is a collection of files I have configured for my development environment.
Feel free to use whatever you find useful. However, I recommend
that you understand what settings you are using before applying them to your
own development environment.

Setting up Apps
---------------
In order to run the `brew.sh` setup, simply run `sh brew.sh` while in the `dotfiles`
directory. This will install various applications on a Mac OS which I use. You will
likely need to change this file based on which applications you use.


Setting up Bash Preferences
---------------------------
You may also need to `source .bashrc` in your `.bash_profile` file.

Setting up Mac OS Preferences
-----------------------------
In order to apply the settings for your Mac, you will need to run `source .macos`
while in the `dotfiles` directory.
